As a team lead for a software engneeeing course, this project is done with three people team to build a platformer game called 'Caveman'.

Caveman is a fun and intense game where a man living in the stone age goes under the cave to collect ores and minerals because 'Man like shiny things'. But the increasing level of lava
puts pressure on the caveman to collect gems as fast as he can and escape before he is engulfed in the hot lava.
